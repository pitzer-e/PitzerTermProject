        "Welcome to the help section of my app! In this section I will hopefully be able to outline"
        "some information that you might find helpful. The application should open up to a splash"
        "screen when you first launch it, which will display for 10 seconds. The next screen you"
        "will see is the main screen, which has the following items for you to utilize in the"
        "navigation bar in the upper left hand corner.\n\n"

        "Create New.\n\n"

        "The create new section will allow you to create a brand new help ticket. On this page, "
        "you will be welcomed by a number of entry field boxes which will allow you to fill out"
        "the information that you would like to add to your ticket. After filling out all of the"
        "fields that you wish add information to, you can then add the ticket to the database."
        "You can then view this ticket alongside others that might be present as well, or you"
        "can also choose to edit the ticket. Both of these options are discussed below.\n\n"

        "Edit Existing.\n\n"

        "The edit existing section will allow you to edit a ticket that currently exists in the"
        "database. On the screen, you will be prompted with a field entry box for you to enter"
        "the ticket number which you would like to edit (if you aren't sure which ticket it is you"
        "wish to edit, please make use of my handy-dandy view ticket section, discussed next)!"
        "Once you enter the required ticket number entry field, you will be greeted with the option"
        "to edit any field of the ticket, other than the ticket number.\n\n"

        "View Tickets.\n\n"

        "The view current tickets section is a page which will allow you to view all current"
        "tickets that exist within the system. The system automatically increments the ticket"
        "number, which is the first piece of information listed on the left-hand side of the page."
        "While this panel does not allow you to make any edits or changes to the tickets that"
        "are present, it allows you to get a high level perspective of the tickets which are"
        "available to edit.\n\n"
