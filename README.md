# PitzerTermProject
 This is my term project using Android Studio for mobile applications development at EOU
This program mimics a simple, locally hosted "helpdesk ticket" system. In it, the user
may create new tickets by filling out the required fields. The user may also use the
navigation drawer to move to Edit and View tabs, where the user can edit existing
tickets in the database, or view all the existing tickets that are presently stored
in the database. I followed the tutorial below to build the primary body of this program,
and wish to give thanks!
